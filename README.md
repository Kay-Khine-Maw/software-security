# Software Security

A modern, hands-on undergraduate course in software security. Every week pairs a lecture concept with a lab in which students either **break** an intentionally vulnerable target in a safe sandbox or **defend** code they write themselves.

Aligned with **OWASP Top 10 (2025)**, **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025)**, the **OWASP API Security Top 10**, **MITRE CWE/ATT&CK**, and the **SLSA** supply-chain framework.

> ⚠️ **Ethics first.** All offensive techniques are taught for **defensive and authorized testing only**. Read [ETHICS.md](ETHICS.md) before starting any lab. Attack only the provided sandbox targets or systems you have **explicit written permission** to test.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd software-security
# each lab is self-contained:
cd labs/week01-threat-modeling
cat README.md            # follow the lab guide
docker compose up        # (where a target is provided)
```

**Base requirements (Docker-first):** **Docker Desktop**, Git, and a browser proxy (Burp Suite Community or OWASP ZAP) — every lab runs via `docker compose up`, no full VM needed. A few weeks (mainly W11) use the **`labs/toolbox`** container for Linux dev/attacker tools; a Kali/Ubuntu VM is an optional fallback. See [labs/week01-threat-modeling/README.md](labs/week01-threat-modeling/README.md) for the full "Lab 0" setup.

## License

Two licences, because this repository holds two kinds of work:

- **Course material** (worksheets, slides, lab guides, exams, CTF briefs) — **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**. See [LICENSE-CONTENT](LICENSE-CONTENT).
- **Platform code** (`labs/live-quiz/`, `tools/`, scripts) — **MIT**. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

Third-party vulnerable targets (Juice Shop, DVWA, crAPI, etc.) keep their own licences and are *referenced, not redistributed*. Files that ARE bundled — the Inter font (OFL) and the Socket.IO client (MIT) — are listed in [NOTICE](NOTICE).

The deliberately vulnerable lab code carries the MIT licence's "AS IS", no-warranty terms, and they are meant literally: don't deploy it, don't copy patterns out of it, don't expose it to an untrusted network.
