## 1. Course Description

This course teaches students how software fails under attack and how to build software that resists it. It blends timeless fundamentals (memory safety, injection, authentication, cryptography misuse) with the threats that dominate modern systems: **software supply-chain attacks, cloud and container misconfiguration, API abuse, and the security of AI/LLM-powered applications.**

The course is deliberately hands-on. Every week pairs a lecture concept with a lab in which students either *break* an intentionally vulnerable target in a safe sandbox or *defend* code they write themselves. Students leave able to threat-model a system, find and exploit common vulnerability classes, remediate them, and integrate security checks into a CI/CD pipeline.

The course is aligned with current industry references including the **OWASP Top 10 (2025)**, the **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025)**, the **OWASP API Security Top 10**, **MITRE ATT&CK / CWE**, and the **SLSA** supply-chain framework.

---

## 2. Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. **Threat-model** a software system and reason about its attack surface, trust boundaries, and adversary capabilities.
2. **Identify and exploit** common vulnerability classes (injection, broken access control, memory-safety bugs, insecure design) in a controlled environment.
3. **Write and review secure code**, applying input validation, output encoding, safe defaults, and least privilege.
4. **Apply cryptography correctly**, recognizing common misuse and selecting appropriate primitives.
5. **Secure the modern software supply chain** using dependency analysis, SBOMs, artifact signing, and build provenance.
6. **Secure cloud, container, and API workloads**, including IAM, secrets management, and configuration hardening.
7. **Assess and defend AI/LLM-powered applications** against prompt injection, insecure output handling, and excessive agency.
8. **Integrate security into the development lifecycle** (SAST, DAST, SCA, secret scanning) within a CI/CD pipeline (DevSecOps).
9. **Disclose vulnerabilities responsibly** and communicate risk to technical and non-technical stakeholders.
10. **Reason adversarially** — given a system, generate plausible attacker goals, work out what an attacker with limited knowledge and budget would actually try first, and explain *why* a control does or does not stop them. This is the disposition the other nine outcomes are in service of, and it is assessed directly: in the Week 1 systems-level pass, in every worksheet's abuse cases, and as a scored dimension of the midterm and final CTF.

## 3. Why This Course Is "Modern"

Traditional software-security courses stop at buffer overflows and SQL injection. Those still matter and are covered here — but the 2025 threat landscape has shifted toward **design-level and dependency-level failures**. The OWASP Top 10:2025 made this explicit by adding **Software Supply Chain Failures** as a new top-tier category and elevating **Security Misconfiguration** to #2. This course reflects that shift and adds two areas most curricula still lack:

- **Software supply-chain security** (SLSA, SBOMs, Sigstore/Cosign, dependency confusion, typosquatting).
- **AI/LLM application security** (the OWASP LLM Top 10, prompt injection, RAG/vector-store risks, agentic systems).

---

## 4. Lab Environment

All offensive work is performed **only** against instructor-provided, intentionally vulnerable targets inside an isolated sandbox. Students never attack systems they do not own or lack written permission to test.

**Required toolkit (all free / open source) — Docker-first:**

- **Docker Desktop** (Windows / macOS / Linux) — runs every lab target via `docker compose up`. *No full VM required.*
- **Lab toolbox container** (`labs/toolbox`) — a small Linux image with `clang`+libFuzzer, `gdb`, `nmap`, `sqlmap` for the weeks that need Linux dev/attacker tools (mainly **Week 11**).
- **Git + a GitHub account** — for labs, CI/CD, and the term project.
- Browser with **Burp Suite Community** or **OWASP ZAP** — web/API testing proxy.
- *Optional fallback:* a **Kali/Ubuntu VM** (VirtualBox/UTM) if your host can't run Docker.

**Pre-built vulnerable targets used during the term:**

- **OWASP Juice Shop** — modern web app vulnerabilities.
- **OWASP WebGoat** — guided web-security lessons.
- **DVWA** (Damn Vulnerable Web Application).
- **crAPI / Damn Vulnerable Web Services** — API security.
- **pwn.college / picoCTF / OverTheWire** — binary and systems exploitation.
- **Gandalf / a self-hosted vulnerable LLM chatbot** — prompt-injection practice.

A one-page **"Lab 0" setup guide** is provided in Week 1 so the whole environment can be stood up in under an hour via a single `docker compose up`.

## 6. Assessment

| Component | Weight | Graded |
|---|---|---|
| Weekly lab worksheets — 13 graded | 30% | **Individual** |
| Midterm — Week 8 (written) + Week 9 (CTF practical) | 20% | **Individual** |
| Final — Week 18 written *(individual)* + Week 19 capstone CTF *(team)* | 25% | Mixed |
| Term project (secure build + threat model + remediation report) | 15% | **Team of 2–3** |
| Weekly quizzes (drop lowest 1–2) + participation / **Houses** leaderboard | 10% | Individual + Houses |

> **Individual vs team.** Your grade is dominated by **individual mastery** (worksheets,
> quizzes, exams = ~75%). **Team** work is bounded (project 15% + the Week 19 capstone CTF).
> The fun **weekly games** (Bug Triage Race, XSS Golf, the CTFs, …) score toward the **Houses
> leaderboard under participation** — they drive engagement, **not** the 30% worksheet grade,
> so a quiet teammate can't pull your mark down.

**Term project.** In teams of 2–3, students take a small web/API application, threat-model it, find and document its vulnerabilities, remediate them, generate an SBOM, sign the release artifact, and wire up a security CI pipeline. Deliverables: a threat model, a vulnerability report mapped to CWE/OWASP, the fixed code, and a short demo. Each member's mark is scaled by a short **peer-contribution evaluation** (see `project/README.md`).

**Term project rubric (100 pts, scales the 15% above):**

| Criterion | Pts |
|---|---|
| Threat model quality & completeness | 20 |
| Vulnerability findings (correctness, CWE/OWASP mapping, depth) | 25 |
| Remediation quality (correct, minimal, well-explained) | 25 |
| Supply-chain hardening (SBOM + signing + provenance) | 15 |
| CI pipeline (works, fails build appropriately) | 10 |
| Presentation & report clarity | 5 |

**Teams & Houses.** Two layers, one structure:
- **Houses** — large, persistent, **mixed-ability** groups for the whole term. They drive the season-long **CTFd leaderboard**, Hall of Fame, and the weekly games. **Houses are not graded** (pure engagement — free-riding can't affect anyone's grade).
- **Project teams of 2–3** **nest inside** a House. This is the only *graded* group unit, protected by per-student flags + the peer-contribution evaluation.

**Late submissions.** −10% of that item's score per day late, up to 3 days; not accepted after
day 3 without an approved extension. Weekly quizzes are the exception — they're timed and taken
in class, so there is no late window (an absence there is covered instead by the drop-lowest-1–2
rule in the table above). Documented emergencies (medical, bereavement) get a case-by-case
extension at the instructor's discretion, arranged before the deadline where possible.

## 7. Academic Integrity & Ethics Policy

All offensive techniques are taught for **defensive and authorized testing** purposes only. Students must:

- Attack only the targets provided in the course sandbox or systems for which they hold **explicit written authorization**.
- Never use course material against third-party systems, the university network, or fellow students.
- Follow **responsible/coordinated disclosure** if they incidentally discover a real vulnerability.

Violations are treated as serious academic-integrity and conduct breaches. Students sign an ethics acknowledgment in Week 1.
