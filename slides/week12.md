# Week 12
## Software Supply-Chain Security
Software Security · Nutthakorn Chalaemwongwan

<!-- Hook: ask how many lines of code they wrote in their last project vs how many they shipped. The gap is dependencies — and that's the attack surface this week. One poisoned package = thousands of victims. ~2 min. -->

---

## Today

- Why the supply chain is now top-tier
- Dependency confusion & typosquatting
- SBOMs, SLSA provenance
- Signing with Sigstore/Cosign
- 🎮 Game: **Dependency Confusion Heist**

<!-- Roadmap, 1 min. Three verbs to remember all week: KNOW your ingredients (SBOM), PROVE your build (SLSA), SIGN your artifacts (Cosign). -->

---

## The new #1 design risk

- Your code is ~10% yours, ~90% dependencies
- One bad package → thousands of victims (xz, event-stream, SolarWinds)
- **OWASP A03:2025 Software Supply Chain Failures**

<!-- New in OWASP 2025 — promoted to A03, reflecting reality. The 10/90 ratio shocks students. You can write perfect code and still be owned through a dependency you never read. ~4 min. -->

---

## Real supply-chain attacks

| Case | What happened |
|---|---|
| **SolarWinds** (2020) | trojanized vendor update → 18k orgs |
| **Log4Shell** (2021) | RCE in a ubiquitous logging dep |
| **event-stream** (npm) | malicious dep stole crypto-wallet keys |
| **XZ Utils** (2024) | backdoor planted in `liblzma` upstream |
| **CircleCI** (2023) | stolen CI tokens → customer secrets |

> Attacks are shifting **upstream**: registry → maintainer → CI/CD.

<!-- Spend time on xz (2024): a patient attacker became a trusted maintainer over years, then planted a backdoor caught only by luck (a 0.5s SSH delay). The lesson: trust in maintainers is itself attackable. ~5 min. -->

---

## Attack vectors

- **Typosquatting** — `reqeusts` vs `requests`; the malicious package's `setup.py` runs **at install time**, before any of your code runs — you don't have to import it to be owned
- **Dependency confusion** (**CWE-1357**) — public pkg shadows internal name
- **Malicious updates** — compromised maintainer
- **Transitive risk** — deps of deps you never chose

<!-- Define dependency confusion clearly (it's the game): if your internal pkg "acme-utils" isn't scoped, a public "acme-utils" with a higher version number can get pulled instead. Transitive = you vet your 10 deps, but they pull 800 you never saw. Stress the install-time-execution point — it's why "I never imported it" isn't a defense, and it's exactly what the lab's PWNED.txt marker proves. ~5 min. -->

---

## Try it — which package actually installs?

Set both versions and the index mode. The resolver's real rule decides.

```sim
resolver-confusion
```

<!-- Let them find the uncomfortable case themselves: merged mode with the private version numerically HIGHER also happens to be "safe" — but say explicitly that this is not a defense, just luck, since the attacker picks their own version number and will publish something higher. The only real fix in this sim is switching to single-index mode. Ties directly to Task 2 and Task 4's defense #2. ~4 min. -->

---

## SCA — find vulnerable deps

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" aquasec/trivy fs /src   # this lab's Python deps
pip-audit                                                          # vs PyPI advisories
```

- Produces CVEs + fix versions
- CWE-1104 (unmaintained), CWE-829 (untrusted inclusion), **CWE-1395** (known-vulnerable 3rd-party dependency)

<!-- Hands-on tooling (ties to W2 SCA). This lab is pure Python — no npm project — so it's trivy fs + pip-audit, not npm audit/dependency-check. Run trivy live on the project — it lists CVEs + the fixed version. Q6 of the quiz asks for one real vulnerable dependency they found + remediation. ~4 min. -->

---

## Integrity: prove what you shipped

- **SBOM** (CycloneDX/SPDX) — ingredient list of the build
- **SLSA** — levels of build provenance & tamper-resistance
- **A08:2025** Software/Data Integrity Failures

<!-- SBOM = the food-label analogy: you can't manage what you can't list. When the next Log4Shell drops, an SBOM answers "are we affected?" in seconds. SLSA Build Track = levels L0–L3 of build provenance / tamper-resistance (L3 is the top; the old "1–4" numbering was v0.1 and is deprecated). ~5 min. -->

---

## Signing with Cosign (keyless)

```bash
IMG=week12-supplychain:lab
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  aquasec/trivy:latest image --format cyclonedx \
  --output /src/sbom.cdx.json "$IMG"                          # SBOM
docker run --rm -e COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign:latest sign --yes "$IMG"       # sign (OIDC)
docker run --rm -e COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign:latest verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp ".*" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer-regexp ".*" "$IMG"                 # verify
```

- Unsigned/tampered image → verification fails
- **Every step needs the docker-socket mount** (trivy has to reach the local image, not just a local dir) — the SBOM step is a common copy-paste failure if it's dropped
- **`cosign verify` needs the two `--certificate-*-regexp` flags** in keyless mode — without them it errors, it doesn't just "fail closed"
- Keyless signing is backed by **Fulcio** (short-lived cert authority) + **Rekor** (public transparency log) — no long-lived private key sitting on disk to leak (**CWE-321**)

<!-- Demo the sign→verify loop. sign.sh runs both tools dockerized — match that here, not a bare local binary. Keyless (Sigstore) = identity-based signing via OIDC through Fulcio, logged in Rekor, no key to leak — name both by name, worksheet Q4 grades on the vocabulary. The deploy gate: refuse any image that doesn't verify → a tampered artifact can't ship. This is the lab's defend step. ~4 min. -->

---

## Tooling — GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)

- **Secret scanning** + **push protection** — block secrets at push time (before they reach the remote)
- **CodeQL** code scanning — semantic SAST queries
- **Dependabot** — alerts + auto-PRs for vulnerable deps
- Native in the repo → results in the Security tab

<!-- The managed option students will meet in industry. Dependabot is the practical supply-chain workhorse: it opens PRs bumping vulnerable deps automatically. Push protection stops secrets at push time — local commits with a secret are allowed, the block fires on push to the remote (recall W2). ~3 min. -->

---

## Defenses

- **`pip install --require-hashes`** — a substituted package's hash won't match; install refuses
- **Single `--index-url`, not `--extra-index-url`** — one trusted index; the resolver won't "shop around" and pick a higher-versioned public package over your internal one
- Verify signatures before deploy (admission policy)
- Generate + store SBOMs per release
- 2FA/MFA on dev/CI/cloud accounts; least privilege
- Automate SCA in CI (next week)

<!-- The payoff checklist, now with the exact flags Task 4 grades. --require-hashes and single-index-url are what actually stops dependency confusion — "pin + scope" alone is too vague to reconstruct on the exam. Verify-before-deploy kills tampered artifacts; MFA on maintainer/CI accounts kills the xz/CircleCI vector. "Automate in CI" sets up W15. ~4 min. -->

---

## The whole journey, one dependency

![Six hops a dependency crosses from a public registry into production, each with its own attack and the control that answers it: registry (typosquatting → one trusted index), resolver (dependency confusion → scope the namespace), fetch (compromised maintainer → lockfile with hashes), build (stale pins → SCA in CI), image (no inventory → SBOM), deploy (unsigned image → Sigstore keyless gate). "We scanned our code" covers none of this — SAST reads the code you wrote, all six hops are code you didn't.](img/supply-chain.svg)

<!-- The synthesis slide — everything from the last five slides (SAST/SCA, SBOM, Cosign, the defenses checklist) is one column each in this diagram, chained in the order a real dependency actually travels. Walk it left to right ONE time, don't re-teach each hop — the point is showing they were never separate tools, they're six links in the same chain. Land on the closing line before moving to the game. ~5 min. -->

---

## 📦 Game — Dependency Confusion Heist

1. **Attack:** no live registry in this lab — use the resolver simulation to watch a higher-version public pkg beat the private one
2. **Defend:** pin + scope; generate SBOM; sign & verify with Cosign; add a provenance gate

<!-- Explain before lab — the resolver simulation stands in for a live registry (ethics: never publish a real typosquat). Defend side is graded. The SLSA self-assessment makes them reason about their own pipeline. ~3 min. -->

---

## Deliverable

> 📋 **Worksheet 12** — `labs/week12-supply-chain/worksheet.md` (Parts 1–4) · **kickoff:** `bash sca_scan.sh` (trivy fs + pip-audit)

- SCA report + remediation plan (Part 3)
- SBOM file + sign/verify transcript (Part 3)
- One-paragraph SLSA self-assessment + XZ Utils case analysis (Part 4)
- **+ Audit the AI / EiPE / Prompt Problem** (required, after Part 4 — see worksheet)

<!-- The SLSA self-assessment is the thinking part — they place their own build on the ladder and justify it. AI-resilient tasks count. -->

---

## Key takeaways

- Most of your attack surface is other people's code
- Know your ingredients (SBOM), prove your build (SLSA), sign your artifacts
- Verify before you trust

<!-- Recap with the three verbs. Cold-call: "the next Log4Shell drops at 2am — what artifact tells you if you're affected?" (the SBOM). ~2 min. -->
